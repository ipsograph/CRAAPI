If you will use video, you must provide the xuggler library:
- xuggle-xuggler-5.4.jar

You must provide the SLF4J library (needed by xuggler):
- slf4j-api-1.7.2jar

Due to licensing conflicts, this JAR is not provided as part 
of this repository. You should be able to obtain these libraries 
via Maven (see pom file in java project).
